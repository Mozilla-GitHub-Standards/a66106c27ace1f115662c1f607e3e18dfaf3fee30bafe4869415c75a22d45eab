[Asksumo] 
Version: 2.0
=====================================

## Adding the app to your Facebook page
You can add the app directly to your facebook page using this link:

https://www.facebook.com/dialog/pagetab?app_id=437951106265166&next=http://apps.facebook.com/asksumo

The content will load from Mozilla Hispano server and will be always updated with all the supported locales and improvements.

## New localization

If you want to request a new localization, you can do it from the ['create a language' feature](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/mozillahispano/languages/add/) and then localize asksumo online from [the project at transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/mozillahispano/resource/asksumo-fb/) (you will need to be logged in)

Once you finish, please [open a new issue here](https://github.com/mozillahispano/asksumo-fb/issues) with "Add YourLocaleName (xx-XX)" as title asking for addition.

(Keep in mind you need to localize [SUMO hot articles](https://support.mozilla.org/topics/hot) in your language in order to be fetched by this app.)

## Self-host the code
*You can also create a new Facebook app and host the code on your own, but if you want to have it updated we recommend to add our already created app*
